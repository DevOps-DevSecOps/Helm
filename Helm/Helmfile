Helmfile is a declarative specification for deploying several Helm charts.

Download the Helmfile binary file from 'https://github.com/roboll/helmfile/releases'.

Rename the file from 'helmfile_linux_amd64' to 'helmfile'.
$ mv helmfile_linux_amd64 helmfile

Change the permission of the file and make it executable.
$ chmod 777 helmfile

Move the file from current location to '/usr/local/bin'.
$ mv helmfile /usr/local/bin

After moving the file verify the Helmfile installation by running the command.
$ helmfile --version
